NAME
       prisma_dtoe - Data to Escape Sequence

SYNOPSIS
       #include <prisma.h>

       const void* prisma_dtoe(struct PrismaEscapeData src, size_t char_size);
       const char* prismas_dtoe(struct PrismaEscapeData src);

DESCRIPTION
       prisma_dtoe()  generates  an escape sequence, using a character storage
       size of char_size,  and	of  maximum  capacity  PRISMA_ESCAPE_CAPACITY.
       Escape sequences can be interpreted with prisma_etod(3).

       prismas_dtoe(src) is equivalent to prisma_dtoe(src, sizeof(char)).

       prisma defines a structure to abstract an escape sequence's meaning and
       data as follows :

       struct PrismaEscapeData {
	   int32_t value;  /* The escape sequence's meaning */
	   uint8_t r;	   /* Optional red value */
	   uint8_t g;	   /* Optional green value */
	   uint8_t b;	   /* Optional blue value */
	   int16_t n;	   /* Optional first informative value */
	   int16_t m;	   /* Optional second informative value */
	   uint8_t length; /* The escape sequence's total length as a string */
       };

       prisma_dtoe() refers to src's value field, and then, depending  on  it,
       take  information  from	other  fields (except the length field, filled
       only by prisma_etod(3) ).

       Basically, one should refer to prisma.h to get an  exhaustive  list  of
       the possible macros usable for a PrismaEscapeData's value field.

       The  optional  r,  g,  and b fields are checked ONLY when relevant (i.e
       when src's value field is PRISMA__BG_EXTENDED of PRISMA__FG_EXTENDED).
       The optional n and m fields are reserved for escape sequences that need
       to  store  information  unrelated  to  color (like x and y coordinates,
       respectively, with PRISMA__CURSOR_POSITION).

GOOD PRACTICES
       prisma_dtoe() is meant for instant printing on the terminal. This means
       that you SHOULD follow these good practices :
       -> Print the result to the console as soon as you get it.
       ->  Do  not  nest  several prisma_dtoe() calls inside a single function
       call, such as printf(3).
       This  is  because  some	obscure  magic	happens  during  a   call   to
       prisma_dtoe()   ,   especially	if  prisma_adapt(3)  was  called  with
       PRISMA__ADAPT__CMD and indeed returned PRISMA__ADAPT__CMD.

       That would mean prisma is adapted to Windows'  cmd.exe,	which  doesn't
       support ANSI Escape Sequences.
       So what would prisma_dtoe() do in that case is :
       ->  Call  relevant  WinAPI  functions,  to  fake  the escape sequence's
       effect;
       -> Return an empty string to prevent actual printing of	weird  charac‚Äê
       ters.

RETURN VALUE
       A  null-terminated string, using a character storage size of char_size,
       and of maximum capacity PRISMA_ESCAPE_CAPACITY, which  becomes  invalid
       on a next call to prisma_dtoe().

ERRORS
       prisma_dtoe()  returns  NULL if char_size is not 1, 2 or 4, or if src's
       value field is invalid or not supported.
       However, if prisma's current adaption is  PRISMA__ADAPT__NOSUPPORT,  an
       empty string is always immediately returned.

EXAMPLE
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <prisma.h>

       int main(void) {
	   struct PrismaEscapeData data;

	   /* You can omit the following line, however the result might be ugly. */
	   prisma_adapt(PRISMA__ADAPT__GUESS);

	   data.value = PRISMA__FG_RED;
	   printf("%sThis is the escape sequence for red foreground\n", prismas_dtoe(data));
	   data.value = PRISMA__FG_EXTENDED;
	   data.r = 255;
	   data.g = 0;
	   data.b = 255;
	   printf("%sThis is the escape sequence for extended foreground", prismas_dtoe(data));
	   data.value = PRISMA__RESET;
	   printf("%s\n", prismas_dtoe(data));
	   exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
