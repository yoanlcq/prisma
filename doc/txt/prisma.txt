DESCRIPTION
       prisma is a small C/C++ library, which allows easy ANSI escape sequence
       generation and interpretation.
       Moreover, it provides some funny functions to play with colors.
       This is prisma 1.0.0. In this  version,	prisma	supports  only	Select
       Graphics Rendition (SGR) ANSI escape sequences.

       It  is NOT destined to text-based user interfaces. For this, one should
       rather use ncurses.

       However, prisma can adapt the ANSI escape  sequences  it  generates  to
       Xterm, Linux TTY, and fake their behaviour on Window's cmd.exe.

       prisma's  main purpose is to be used in small applications that need to
       store extra informations inside of strings, that should not  be	inter‐
       preted  as  text  (for  instance,  storing  a text along with its color
       within a single string).

       Applications that would make a great use of prisma would be small  chat
       widgets,  in-game  command-lines,  informative  loading screens and the
       like.

GENERAL USE
       All of prisma's constants and  functions  are  prefixed,  respectively,
       with  'PRISMA__'  and  'prisma_'. Those starting with '_' are meant for
       internal use only.  Some of prisma's functions come with a shorter ver‐
       sion, prefixed by 'prismas_' (note the 's' at the end).

       Depending  on  what you wish to do, here is where to get started. Exam‐
       ples are given in each of prisma's manual pages.

       Generate escape sequences :
       prisma_dtoe(3)

       Interpret escape sequences :
       prisma_etod(3)

       Adapt prisma's output to a specific terminal :
       prisma_adapt(3)

       Play with colors :
       prisma_bytestoargb(3)
       prisma_argbtobytes(3)
       prisma_gradient(3)
       prisma_xtermtoargb(3)
       prisma_argbtoxterm(3)
       prisma_8colortoargb(3)
       prisma_argbto8color(3)

NOTES
       prisma originated as a BASH script printing a  given  text  in  rainbow
       colors.	It  would  work  properly  only on Xterm, and the RGB-to-xterm
       color conversion algorithm was empiric and insane. Today, prisma  makes
       writing such a program far easier.
