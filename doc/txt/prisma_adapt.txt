NAME
       prisma_adapt  -	adapt prisma's generated escape sequences for printing
       on a terminal.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <prisma.h>

       int8_t prisma_adapt(int8_t adaptation);

DESCRIPTION
       A call to  prisma_adapt()  sets	prisma's  current  output  adaptation,
       depending on adaptation which may be one of the following constants :

       PRISMA__ADAPT__FULLSUPPORT
       prisma  produces  escape  sequences that can store the highest level of
       detail. Some may not be supported by terminals.
       This is prisma's default adaptation, that you should use for  your  own
       graphical applications.

       PRISMA__ADAPT__NOSUPPORT
       prisma produces empty strings instead of escape sequences.

       PRISMA__ADAPT__XTERM
       prisma produces escape sequences that Xterm understands.

       PRISMA__ADAPT__LINUXTTY
       prisma produces escape sequences that Linux TTY understands.

       PRISMA__ADAPT__CMD
       prisma  produces  empty	strings  instead of escape sequences. However,
       after a call to prisma_dtoe(3) , some WinAPI functions may be called to
       alter the command line in the expected way.
       To know more, see prisma_dtoe(3).

       PRISMA__ADAPT__GUESS
       prisma tries to guess the adaptation that would suit the current user's
       terminal. But since there is not a fully reliable way to do  this,  one
       should use it with care. See below.

RETURN VALUE
       The  adaptation	that  prisma  actually	used.  Especially  when  using
       PRISMA__ADAPT__GUESS you're strongly invited to check  this  value,  to
       prevent unexpected behaviours.
       Chances	are  prisma doesn't support or recognize your terminal at run‚Äê
       time. In this case, it would adapt to PRISMA__ADAPT__NOSUPPORT.

ERRORS
       prisma_adapt() returns PRISMA__ADAPT__NOSUPPORT if anything went wrong.

EXAMPLE
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <prisma.h>

       int main(void) {
	   struct PrismaEscapeData green, reset;
	   if(prisma_adapt(PRISMA__ADAPT__GUESS) != PRISMA__ADAPT__NOSUPPORT) {
	       green.value = PRISMA__FG_GREEN;
	       reset.value = PRISMA__RESET;
	       printf("prisma supports your terminal !\n");
	       printf("%sThere, have a green text !", prismas_dtoe(green));
	       printf("%s\n", prismas_dtoe(reset));
	   } else {
	       fprintf(stderr, "prisma doesn't support your terminal.\n");
	   }
	   exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
